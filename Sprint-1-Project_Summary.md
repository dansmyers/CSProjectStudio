# Sprint 1 Project Summary and Initial Backlog

## Due Tuesday, June 9

## Overview

This assignment will be the primary deliverable from your first sprint. Write a roughly three page summary of your proposed project. 
Your document should include:

- The broad area that you want to work in and why you are interested in it.

- What you propose to build.

- What languages / tools / frameworks you're going to use and why factors went into making those choices.

- The current status of the project: what you've done and learned so far.

- A **prospective** list of features that you know you need to complete. This is called the **project backlog** and you'll continue to
work with it for the rest of the class.

## Format

You can submit a Word document on Canvas. Use reasonable margins, line spacing, and font size.
I suggest dividing it into the following sections:

- Project Topic

- Deliverable Project: this includes the description of what you want to create and the tools that you're going to use

- Feature Backlog: the list of things that you know you still need to complete

- Any references that are relevant to your write-up

It's okay to write this like it's a blog post or journal write-up: it doesn't need to have the tone of an academic article or --- shudder --- a *research paper*.

## Project Backlog

The first two sections are straightforward: write about your interests, what you want to do, and what you've done and learned so far.

The last section requires a little bit more thought. Recall from our early discussion of Scrum that one of its key components is the 
**project backlog**: the list of features that have been identified as important for the project, but haven't been implemented yet.
During each planning step, the team and the product owner use the backlog to decide on the scope of work for the next sprint

I want you put together an initial backlog for your project. It should be a list --- **sorted by priority** --- of the things you need
to learn, do, or program to have a working version of your project.

You'll be able to revisit this list every sprint and add, remove, or modify its contents. As a general rule, the highest priority
items (at the top of the list) will be the items you'll focus on during the next sprint.

The most important things about this backlog is **to be as specific as possible** when formulating its contents. For example, if you're
working on recommendation engines, you could list "Learn about recommendation engines" as one of your high-priority backlog items.
That goal, however, is vague --- how could you judge your progress on that step or know when it's done enough to be able to move on
to the next item?

In Scrum terms, every backlog item should be supplemented with a **Definition of Done** (DoD). The DoD outlines what criteria need to be
met to consider that item finished and acceptable. For example, in an industry software project, this might be a suite of tests that the 
new feature has to pass.

You don't need to write separate DoDs for every item on your backlog. Instead, I suggest breaking each task down into small enough units
that it's clear whether a unit is done or not. Returning to the previous example, you could break "Learn about recommendation engines"
into reading and taking notes on a collection of articles about different recommendation strategies. When you've read each article, you
know that you've satisfied that step.

If you have a step that seems important but you don't know how to break into smaller tasks, it usually points to a gap in your
knowledge. Your goal then becomes learning enough to be able to break the big task down into sub tasks.

## Estimates

One last element that will go into your backlog: provide an **estimate** of how long you think each task will take.

Coming up with good estimates is famously tough. In fact, it's probably the hardest part of agile development in pratice, which
can often lead to teams taking on too much work during a sprint.

Here's a suggestion: mark each item as taking 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, or more than 4 hours.

- 1 hour: tasks that can be done in roughly one work session.

- 2 hours: tasks that probably need more than one work session, but not more than a few days.

- 4 hours: tasks that need between two or three days and a week.

- More than 4 hours: anything that would take this long is too large or uncertain and can't be estimated accurately.

The goal is not to get perfect estimates, although you'll probably get better with time. Rather, the estimating process is about 
helping you plan and schedule your work. If, for example, all of your high priority tasks are marked at four or more hours, that 
suggests that you might need to refine your backlog to break them into smaller units.

Ideally, the top of your backlog should be composed of well-scoped 1 and 2 hour tasks with clear Definitions of Done.

There are lots of articles about Scrum backlogs and proudct owners. Start with this one if you'd like another perspective and
