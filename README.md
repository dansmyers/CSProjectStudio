## Official Course Description

**CMS 395 CS Project Studio**: Supervised individual project development in an area of the student's interest. Emphasizes the
development of complete applications using new languages or frameworks, regular demonstration of work-in-progress, and
critical reflection on your own development practices.

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

Robert-Fleury's Atelier at Acad√©mie Julian for female art students - painting by student Marie Bashkirtseff (1881)

In the old days, an *atelier* was a artists' workshop, where apprentices learned the craft of art under the guidance of an experienced teacher.

This course wil give you the opportunity to dig deep into an area of computer science that interests you. If you wish, you'll be able
to work on areas of CS or use tools and frameworks that are outside the scope of the normal curriculum. Your goal, over the next
twelve weeks, will be to produce a series of real, working software projects demonstrating what you've learned. I will be with you along 
the way, to provide advice and guide you to useful resources.

(I know that a few of you are using this class to catch up on requirements that you can't take according to the normal course sequence: we'll talk about those individually).

Along the way, we're going to learn some more about how to plan and execute a larger software project, how to find and use your own
learning resources, and how to reflect and improve on your own processes.


## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your earlier courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two weeks.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll create a plan and define a target deliverable that you'll complete by the end of the sprint.
Your deliverable should be a piece of **working software**. In the early stages of your project, this might mean writing small programs
to get familiar with the tools that you're using, but after the first couple of sprints you'll probably be adding features to one major
project that will take you through the end of the course.

3. During the sprint, you'll demo your work-in-progress during our scheduled class meetings, answer questions, and receive feedback.

4. Each sprint ends with a reflective assessment where you'll write about the work that you completed and reflect on how you can work
more effectively in the next sprint.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Ungrading

Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

I'm proposing to **ungrade** this class. There will be no marks, points, or letter grades on the work you complete. Instead, you will complete the reflective self-assessments and I will write provide you with written feedback in the form of process letters at the end of each sprint. 

At the end of the semester, **you will decide what grade you should receive**, based on a detailed assessment of the work you've completed during the course. Yes, you read that correctly. Go back and read it again.

This means exactly what it sounds like:

- Your grade will not be determined by percentages, points, or any other scoring mechanism.

- You will have to work on and make progress on your individual project during the semester, but I will not be directly assessing or scoring the work you complete. This means it isn't possible to "fail" your project: you just complete as much as you complete.

- I will provide you with formal, written feedback at regular intervals discussing my observations of your work and the process you're using. This will allow me to focus my work on being a **coach** for your projects rather than an **evaluator**.

- **You get to choose your own final letter grade**. Per the college's policy, I have the ultimate responsibility to determine grades, so I will make sure that your self-assessment is reasonable given the work that you've completed during the course. **I reserve the right to change grades as appropriate**, but I will honor your self-assessment.

### Question You May Have at This Point

#### This Sounds Like a Bunch of Hippie Nonsense

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Yo7eaFpgMcMYPBvzUYn_MeZlC9c=/2x239:2993x1921/720x405/media/img/2017/12/AP_6708260168/original.jpg" width="50%" />

That's not really a question, but let's address the fact that this style of ungrading is unusual. In my long experience, I've never taken a class that operated under anything other than a standard, traditional points-out-of-100 grading system.




### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Assignments and Scoring
We'll have four kinds of assignments in the class:

1. Short reflective pieces and concept maps completed at the end of each sprint.
2. Team deliverables due at the end of each sprint.
3. Indvidual quizzes
4. A final exam.

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. 
A "satisfactory" assignment corresponds to a B-level performance, which is **a higher standard** than we often associate with that term. It means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

I'll grade the quizzes on a scale from 0 to 2:

0. No submission, or too incomplete to grade.
1. Shows effort, but has serious issues.
2. Satisfactory.

### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following six criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of all reflective assignments and concept maps.
2. Satisfactory completion of *N - 1* quizzes (I'll ignore your lowest quiz).
3. Satisfactory work on all of the team sprint deliverables.
4. Satisfactory work on major project #1.
5. Satisfactory work on major project #2.
6. Satisfactory performance on the final exam.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| For unsatisfactory performance on              | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| One quiz beyond the one you're allowed to drop | Fraction of a letter grade (e.g. B to B-)       |
| Additional quizzes                             | A full letter grade (e.g. B to C)        |
| One team deliverable                           | Fraction of a letter grade                      |
| Additional team deliverables                   | A full letter grade                      |
| The final exam                                 | A full letter grade                      |
| Failure to complete all reflective assignments | A full letter grade                      |
| Failure to submit an assignment                | Double the regular penalty for an unsatisfactory submission |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you fail to achieve satisfactory performance on two quizzes (beyond the one you're allowed drop), your base grade would be lowered by 1.5 letters, from B to C-.

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work that shows deeper engagement with the course goals.

| For successfully completing                         | Your grade will be adjusted upwards by   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| A challenge assignment (there will be at least two) | Half a letter grade                      |
| An in-depth reflective writing assignment           | Half a letter grade                      |
| Tutorial blog post           | Half a letter grade                      |

If your grade drops, you can still complete extra work to boost it up. For example, you could struggle with one team deliverable, but
complete the reflective writing assignment. The two would cancel each other out and your grade would remain a B.

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It gives you choices for how to attain higher grades. You can boost your grade by completing individual programming assignments, superior team-based projects, or an in-depth reflection.

4. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

5. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

6. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### What About My Partial Credit?

You may feel uncomfortable about the two-level grading scale. This will pass.

1. Two-level grading is faster, so I will be able to return work more quickly and put more effort into giving you meaningful feedback.

2. Two-level grading is more consistent. It's easier to sort work into two bins, rather than slicing it into 100 possible points.

3. Each project will have a spec that clearly explains the requirements for satisfactory work. You can also ask me (through the expert request form) for an evaluation of your work-in-progress.

4. Again, industry doesn't give partial credit. If you're asked to code a feature or prepare a presentation, you're ultimately going to be evaluated on a pass / fail basis.

5. There are six ways to increase your grade. You only need three of them to move from the satisfactory B to an A.

## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
> **‚ÄúOn my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.‚Äù**
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.
