## Official Course Description

**CMS 395 CS Project Studio**: Supervised individual project development in an area of the student's interest. Emphasizes the
development of complete applications using new languages or frameworks, regular demonstration of work-in-progress, and
critical reflection on your own development practices.

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

Robert-Fleury's Atelier at Académie Julian for female art students - painting by student Marie Bashkirtseff (1881)

In the old days, an *atelier* was a combination workshop and school, where apprentices learned the craft of fine art under the guidance of an experienced teacher.

This course wil give you the opportunity to dig deep into an area of computer science that interests you. If you wish, you'll be able
to work on areas of CS or use tools and frameworks that are outside the scope of the normal curriculum. Your goal, over the next
twelve weeks, will be to produce a series of real, working software projects demonstrating what you've learned. I will be with you along 
the way, to provide advice and guide you to useful resources.

(I know that a few of you are using this class to catch up on requirements that you can't take according to the normal course sequence: we'll talk about those individually).

Along the way, we're going to learn some more about how to plan and execute a larger software project, how to find and use your own
learning resources, and how to reflect and improve on your own processes.


## Scrumage

### What?
This course will be different from other courses you've taken. We'll be using a new course management framework called **Scrumage** ("**Scrum** for **Ag**ile **E**ducation"), originally developed by Dr. Shannon Duvall at Elon University. Scrumage is based on the Scrum project management framework, which you may have used for team-based projects in some of your earlier courses.

### How Does It Work?
Here are the  main features of Scrumage:

1. The course is structured as a series of **sprints**, each lasting two or three weeks.

2. At the beginning of each sprint, you'll create a plan and define a target deliverable that you'll complete by the end of the sprint.
Your deliverable should always be a piece of **working software**. In the early stages of your project, this might mean writing small programs
to get familiar with the tools that you're using, but after the first couple of sprints you'll probably be adding features to one major
project that will take you through the end of the course.

3. During the sprint, you'll demo your work-in-progress during our scheduled class meetings, answer questions, and receive feedback.

4. Each sprint ends with a reflective assessment where you'll write about the work that you completed and reflect on how you can work
more effectively in the next sprint.

### That Sounds Hard. Why Are We Doing This?
Scrumage is based on **student choice**, **flexibility**, and **reflection**.

In a traditional course, the professor is in charge of every aspect of the class. I get to decide what we learn, in what order, what readings or resoures we use, and how your learning will be assessed. If my choices don't work for you, well, that's tough.

In this class, you'll have **freedom** to take ownership of your own learning. You'll have the broad ability to make your own schedule, choose your own combination of resources (lectures, readings, videos, examples, etc.), and generally pick the best individualized strategies that help you master the course material.

Scrumage will let you **learn computer science concepts** by **working like a computer scientist**. Scrum is an industry-standard framework, so you'll be building facility with real software development techniques as you work through this course.

Finally, Scrumage supports **learning how to learn**, the **single most important skill you can acquire in college**. By taking ownership of your own learning, you'll be able to identify the resources, plans, and strategies that work best for you and build skills that you can take forward into other classes or your professional career.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Ungrading

Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

I'm proposing to **ungrade** this class. There will be no marks, points, or letter grades on the work you complete. Instead, you will complete the reflective self-assessments and I will provide you with written feedback in the form of process letters at the end of each sprint. 

At the end of the semester, **you will decide what grade you should receive**, based on a detailed assessment of the work you've completed during the course. Yes, you read that correctly. Go back and read it again.

This means exactly what it sounds like:

- Your grade will not be determined by percentages, points, or any other scoring mechanism.

- You will have to work on and make progress on your individual project during the semester, but I will not be directly assessing or scoring the work you complete. This means it isn't possible to "fail" your project: you just complete as much as you complete.

- I will provide you with formal, written feedback at regular intervals discussing my observations of your work and the process you're using. This will allow me to focus on being a **coach** for your projects rather than an **evaluator**.

- **You get to choose your own final letter grade**. Per the college's policy, I have the ultimate responsibility to determine grades, so I will make sure that your self-assessment is reasonable given the work that you've completed during the course. **I reserve the right to change grades as appropriate**, but I will honor your self-assessment.

### Questions You May Have at This Point

#### This sounds like a bunch of hippie nonsense.

<img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Yo7eaFpgMcMYPBvzUYn_MeZlC9c=/2x239:2993x1921/720x405/media/img/2017/12/AP_6708260168/original.jpg" width="50%" />

That's not really a question, but let's acknowledge the fact that this approach is unusual. In my long experience, I've never taken a class that operated under anything other than a traditional points-out-of-100 grading system.

#### Okay, but why are you doing this?

- We are still in an unprecedented global pandemic. The immediate crisis of the spring seems to have abated, at least for now, but there's no telling how things will evolve over the coming weeks and months. This course is fully online, so I don't anticipate disruptions to our course delivery, but we might need to be prepared for other individual disruptions. Under this system, the schedule of the course and the series of sprints is set, but the assessment mechanism is more robust to changes that might come up.

- The purpose of this course is for you to stretch out and create something new. That goal is not really consistent with me setting hard evaluation criteria that you must meet or risk failure. Your project is ultimately going to evolve as you learn more and experiment, and I want to encourage that experimentation, not force you to take a safe path where you know you can get a good grade with minimum effort.

- Along the same lines, I want you to be in control of your own project. That means you have the ability to set your own goals (within the Scrum structure that I've provided) and determine your own criteria for success. If I'm going to give you that responsibility, I should also trust your own evaluation of your work.

- Being able to reflect on your own work and development is a standard part of professional self-evaluations in industry. This course will give you an opportunity to practice reflection and **metacognition** (the skill of thinking about your own thinking). Likewise, developing **intrinsic motivation** and the ability to self-regulate and manage your own work is a key life skill. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

- There's a lot of compelling evidence that grades are mostly a waste of time and, at best, unrelated to learning. Check out the articles below for more.

#### But being graded makes me feel safe and warm.

As much as grades can be a source of anxiety for students, they can also be a source of comfort. Getting regular grades, for many of
us, is a form of positive reinforcement and we can derive a sense of meaning from the goal of "getting a good grade".

If that isn't available, we have to **construct alternate reasons that justify the work** we're putting into the course. I would argue 
that doing that kind of reflection is a *good thing*, for the most part.

That said, please talk to me if you're finding that the ungrading is causing you more anxiety than it alleviates.

#### What do I need to do to get an A?

Do the things you know you're supposed to do.

- Complete meaningful work for every sprint. Don't have any sprints where you fail to accomplish anything.

- Take responsibility for your own progress and the success of your project. Get moving quickly and don't waste time getting started with things.

- Work a little bit every day and don't binge.

- Attend and participate in the course meetings. Give well-prepared demos of your work in progress.

- Reflect on your own work and write meaningful self-evaluations. Use feedback to improve.

## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.

All	test-taking	accommodations	requested	for	this	course	must	first	be	approved	
through	the	Office	of	Accessibility	Services (OAS)	and	scheduled	online	through	
Accommodate at	least	72	hours	before	the	exam.	Official	accommodation	letters	
must	be	received	by	and	discussed	with	the	faculty	in	advance.	 There	will	be	no	
exceptions	given	unless	previously	approved	by	the	OAS with	documentation	of	the	
emergency	situation.	We	highly	recommend	making	all	testing	accommodations	at	
the	beginning	of	the	semester.	OAS staff	are	available	to	assist	with	this	process.

### Citation	Expectations
As	per	the	Academic	Honor	Code,	plagiarism	is	defined	as	“Offering the words, facts,
or ideas of another person as your own in any academic exercise.” In	order	to	avoid	
plagiarism,	all	students	are	expected	to	use	proper	citation	norms.	For	our	course,	
all	assignments	will	use	[faculty	choice	- MLA,	Chicago,	APA,	etc]	citation	style.	

### Absences	– Religious	Holidays	and/or	Campus	Business
The	professor	will	accommodate	a	reasonable	number	of	excused	absences	for	
religious	holidays	and	official	off-campus	college	business	such	as	academic	
conference	presentations	and	athletic	competitions.	However,	per	the	College’s	
policy	on	excused	absences	
(http://www.rollins.edu/catalogue/academic_regulations.html#class-attendance),	
students	must	discuss	with	the	professor	the	dates	of	the	anticipated	absences	no	
later	than	the	last	day	of	the	drop	period.	Students	must	present	to	their	professor	
written	evidence	of	the	anticipated	absences	and	discuss	with	him/her	how	and	
when	make-up	work	should	be	completed	prior	to	missing	the	class.	Students	
should	not	expect	to	receive	allowance	for	excused	absences	if	they	do	not	meet	
with	the	professor	beforehand	and	clarify	the	dates	as	necessary.	Absences	will	be	
addressed	by	the	faculty	member	in	accordance	with	his/her	attendance	policy.	The	
professor	retains	the	right	to	determine	what	would	be	considered	to	be	a	
reasonable	number	of	absences	(excused	or	otherwise)	for	the	course.	A	student	
will	not	fail	a	course	because	the	number	of	religious	observances	and/or	college	
business	absences	exceed	the	number	of	absences	allowed,	except	if	excessive	
absences	make	it	impossible	to	fulfill	the	expectations	of	the	course.	The	student’s	
class	participation	grade	in	the	course,	though,	may	still	be	affected.

### Credit	Hour	Statement	for	Rollins	Courses
This	course	is	a	four-credit-hour	course	that	meets	three	hours	per	week.	The	value	
of four	credit	hours	results,	in	part,	from	work	expected	of	enrolled	students	both	
inside	and	outside	the	classroom. Rollins	faculty	require	that	students	average	at	
least	2	½	hours	of	outside	work	for	every	hour	of	scheduled	class	time. In	this	
course,	the	additional	outside-of-class	expectations	are	self-directed learning and
substantial team-based projects.

### Recording	Device Use
In	order	to	protect	the	integrity	of	the	classroom	experience,	the	use	of	recording	
devices	is	limited	to	either	the	expressed	permission	of	the	faculty	member	or	with
