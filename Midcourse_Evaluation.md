# Midcourse Project Evaluation Write-Up

## Description

We're a little bit past the midpoint of the course, but it's still a good time for you to reflect on how things have gone so far and consider your plans for the remaining few weeks of the class.

Answer the following questions. Please write a good-length paragraph of text (3-6 sentences) for each one.

- Describe the state of your project so far. What have you accomplished?

- Talk about your working process. When and how are you getting things done? Are there any changes you should make?

- What new skills, tools, and facts have you had to acquire to work on your project? (It's okay to make a list).

- *Metacognition* is the act of thinking about your own thinking. Critically evaluating your own learning process ("learning how to learn") is the **single most important
skill you can acquire in college**. Reflect on what you've had to learn for your project and what that's revealed about your own strengths and weaknesses as a learner.

- Based on your work so far in the course, what grade do you think you deserve? Why? Be objective!

- If your goal is to earn a better grade, what can you accomplish over the remaining course time to justify a better outcome?

- Describe your goals and plans for the remainder of the course.
